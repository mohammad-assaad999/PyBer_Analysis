## Overview of the analysis
  In this project and based on V. Isualize request, I was working with my colleague, Omar, on creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Using the well organized dataframes and the clear line graph, we have demonstrated that urban cities have the highest fares compared to suburban and rural cities. 
  
## Results
### Summary Dataframe
  From the large data of number of rides and drivers in each city type with the different ranges of fares, we were able to analyze and conclude the main points and differences among the cities types. We've merged the rides and cities data and calculated the number of rides, drivers, and fares of each city type. Then we have gotten the percentages of each city type from the totals and added them to a small summary table for analysis as we see below.

  Because the numbers of riders and drivers in the rural cities were low, the fares per ride and driver were high. The inverse relationship was applied to all the city types since the supply of drivers and demand for rides weren't in equilibrium. The total riders and total drivers in the urban cities were 13 times and almost 31 times, respectively, higher than the ones in the rural cities. As a result, the average fare per rider and driver was much lower than the ones in the rural cities. The urban cities had very high numbers of riders and drivers, so the fares were low compared to the urban and suburban cities. 
### Multiple Line Plot
  Another way to analyze the differences is by plotting all the data in a multiple line graph. This graph is showing the change of the fares of the three different city types over a period of time between January and May, 2019. As we see in the graph below, the fares volatility over the five months wasn't too high, and the change was almost the same in the three city types.

  However, as we discussed before, the total fare in the urban cities was always higher than the suburban and rural cities due to the high supply of drivers and demand for riders in these cities. The urban cities total fare range was between zero and 500 which is four times lower than the ones of urban cities. This shows the circulated money in this sector in every city type. 

## Summary
  In brief, we can recommend the following points to the CEO for addressing the disparities among the city types:
   - Although the average fare per ride and driver in the urban cities is the lowest among all the other city types, the total fares in this city type is the highest due to the high number of rides and drivers
   - The total fares for the urban cities was always higher than any other city type, so working in this city type is the best for the company
   - The change of the weekly total fare of each city type is almsot the same over a specific period of time, so there is no any specific period for the numbers to peak and for taking important desicions during the year
